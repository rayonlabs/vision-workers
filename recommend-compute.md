## Validating
| Component    | Specification                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| VRAM         | 80GB                                  |
| Storage      | 500GB (minimum)<br>1TB (recommended)  |
| RAM          | 128GB+ (recommended)                  |
| Example GPUs | A100 (recommended)<br>H100 (overkill) |
| vCPU's       | 12 (minimum)<br>18+ (recommended)     |

# Recommended compute for a miner
Highly depends on what it is you want to run, which models etc. I'd recommend doing some research into the models and some experiements.

As a rule of thumb;

| Model Type               | VRAM Requirement |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| LLMs | >=50GB           |
| Image generation models  | ~8GB             |
